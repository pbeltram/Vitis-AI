Vitis Vision Library
##############################

The Vitis Vision library is a FPGA device optimized Vitis vision library intended for application
developers using Zynq®-7000 SoC and Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC and PCIE based Alveo® U200 devices. 
Vitis vision library provides a software interface for computer vision functions accelerated on an FPGA device. 

.. note:: 
   Vitis Vision library functions are mostly similar in functionality to their OpenCV equivalent. Any deviations, if present, are documented.
